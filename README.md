**SwiftUI To-Do List with MVVM and UserDefaults Persistence**

This is a fully functional to-do list application built with SwiftUI, adhering to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern for clean separation of concerns. The application leverages UserDefaults to persist task data across app sessions, ensuring your to-dos are always accessible, even after restarting the app.

**Key Features:**

* **Modern SwiftUI Interface:** Enjoy a sleek and intuitive user interface built with SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework for building beautiful and responsive applications on all Apple platforms.
* **MVVM Architecture:** Benefit from a well-structured and maintainable codebase organized using the MVVM pattern. This approach promotes clear separation of concerns, making it easier to reason about your code, test individual components, and scale the application for future growth.
* **UserDefaults Persistence:** Persist your to-do list data seamlessly between app sessions using UserDefaults. This built-in functionality allows you to save and retrieve data efficiently without the need for a complex backend database.

**Potential Benefits:**

* **Learn SwiftUI:** This project serves as a practical example of building user interfaces with SwiftUI, providing valuable hands-on experience with the framework's core concepts.
* **Understand MVVM:** Gain a deeper understanding of the MVVM architecture pattern through real-world application in this project.
* **Explore UserDefaults:** Discover how to effectively utilize UserDefaults for simple data persistence in your SwiftUI applications.
